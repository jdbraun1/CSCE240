This program is an extractor so that I can get the information from my
district. I began with the includes. I added iostream so I could use cin
and cout and I added fstream and sstream so that I could read and write
files. I used namespace std to simplify the coding. My only method reads
the district and outputs the information to an output file with indentation
after every word. District is given in the parameters of the method; however
there needs to be a local version of the district information. The method
checks to see if the input and output files are open and if they are it
initilizes the counts for words, lines, and characters. It uses a while loop
to get the line from the input file and then a while loop to parse each line
to get each single word from the line. Each word is then printed to the output
file with an indent after every word. It then counts the characters in each
word. After that it prints the statistics to the console and closes both files.
It also has an else condition just in case the file can not be opened. 

In main I just have a cin command to get the input from the user in the console.
The command takes the whole line and then searches for the character 9 to see if 
the user asked for my district (the only one I have a local file for). If not it 
it prints there is no local file. If the user asks for district 9 it runs my read
district command that does everything listed above.
