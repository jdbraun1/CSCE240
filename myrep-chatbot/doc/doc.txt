In this program I started by using all my methods from my last project. I modified GetInfo a little bit so it would output to a file as well as
print what was searched for. I had to make the out file name a universal variable so the name could be modified in one method and then called in
all my previously created methods. The one new method I made was create chat file. That one works by getting the time and date using chrono creating
a file and then returning the name of the file for manipulation by the rest of the program. The main function has a few command line options. If 
none are selected then it will run the chatbot until quit is typed. All the chat is stored in a file with name mm-dd-yyyy_hr.min if I tried to use
a colon for the time I got an error. After the user types quit the program calculates all the variables that are put at the bottom of the file.
There is then the else statement for if there was a command line argument. The program supports summary, showchat, and showchat-summary. Any number can
be input and the program will throw an error if the number is too high. Please refer to the log.txt file for examples
of the program interacting.
