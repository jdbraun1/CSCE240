First I had the includes. These enable me to use strings and certain methods that go along with these as well as
load files for inputing information. I initilize the int threshold at the top so it can be edited. I use my old 
getBroadinfo method and it is used for the GetInfo method so that the code  can figure out what is being requested
from the data file. The getInfo method was from program2 and was only modified slightly to produce a result for when
everything is asked. I created the new method matchquery that takes in a string to be matched with known questions. 
MatchQuery returns true if the question is known and false if it is unknown. It refrences the match method which compares 
two strings. If the two strings share a number of words equal to or greater than the threshold it prints the matching phrase
and returns true. After I have my valid district method that I use to check to see if the user is looking for info on the
district that the program has info on. The main method calls valid district it then initiates a random loop where it gets
input from the command line. If the input is quit or q it ends the program. If not it runs MatchQuery and if it gets a response
it asks if there is anything else it can do.
